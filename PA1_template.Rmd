#Loading and preprocessing the data

Load the data.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
activity = read.csv("activity.csv")
```

Process/transform the data (if necessary) into a format suitable for your analysis.
Total number of steps taken per day.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
totalSteps <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data=activity, sum, na.rm=TRUE)
```

#What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
hist(totalSteps$steps, main = "Steps per day", xlab = "Steps", breaks = 8)
```

Mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
mean(totalSteps$steps)
median(totalSteps$steps)
```

The mean of the total number of steps taken per day is `r mean(totalSteps$steps)` steps.
The median of the total number of steps taken per day is `r median(totalSteps$steps)` steps.

#What is the average daily activity pattern?

Time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis).

```{r, echo = TRUE}
stepsInterval <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data = activity, mean, na.rm=TRUE)
plot(steps ~ interval, data = stepsInterval, type="l")
```

Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?

```{r, echo = TRUE}
maxSteps <- stepsInterval[which.max(stepsInterval$steps),]$interval
```

It is the `r maxSteps` interval.

#Imputing missing values

Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with 𝙽𝙰s).

```{r, echo = TRUE}
missing <- sum(is.na(activity$steps))
```

`r missing` missing values are in the dataset.

Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. 
Let's create a function to get the mean steps for particular 5-minute interval.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
intervalToSteps <- function(interval){
        stepsInterval[stepsInterval$interval==interval,]$steps
        }
```

Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
activityGood <- activity
count = 0
for(i in 1:nrow(activityGood)){
        if(is.na(activityGood[i,]$steps)){
                activityGood[i,]$steps <- intervalToSteps(activityGood[i,]$interval)
                count=count+1
                }
        }
cat("Total ", count, "NA values were filled.\n\r") 
```

Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total
number of steps taken per day.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
totalStepsGood <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = activityGood, sum)
hist(totalStepsGood$steps, main = "Steps per day", xlab = "Steps", breaks = 8)
mean(totalStepsGood$steps)
median(totalStepsGood$steps)
```

The mean of the total number of steps taken per day is `r mean(totalStepsGood$steps)` steps.
The median total number of steps taken per day is `r median(totalStepsGood$steps)` steps.

Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?

The mean value is the same as the value before imputing missing data because I put the mean value for that particular 5-min interval. The median value shows a little difference: but it depends on where the missing values are.

#Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
activityGood$day=ifelse(as.POSIXlt(as.Date(activityGood$date))$wday%%6==0,"weekend","weekday")
# For Sunday and Saturday: weekend, other days : weekday 
activityGood$day=factor(activityGood$day,levels=c("weekday","weekend"))
```

Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = "𝚕") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). 

```{r, echo = TRUE}
stepsInterval <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + day, activityGood, mean)
library(lattice)
xyplot(steps ~ interval|factor(day), data=stepsInterval, aspect=1/2, type="l")
```
